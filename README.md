Individual Online Sessions
I offer individual online conversations of 50 minutes. This is a safe space where you can receive support, explore thoughts and emotions, and gain perspective.

Please note that this is not psychology or therapy in a medical sense, and I am not licensed by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare.
